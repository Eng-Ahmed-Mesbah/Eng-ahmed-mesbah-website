    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    
    <p>
        This was a university project where we had to design a hospital reception system using UML diagrams. 
        The project was about creating a system that manages patient registration, appointments, medical 
        tests, billing and other hospital operations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We worked as a team of 5 engineers and we used Visual Paradigm software to make the UML diagrams. 
        The project took us about 3 weeks to complete. It was a good learning experience because we learned 
        how to design systems before coding them.

    <h2>What the system does:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Patient can schedule appointments</li>
        <li>Patient can pay bills</li>
        <li>Patient can be admitted to hospital</li>
        <li>Receptionist collects patient information</li>
        <li>Receptionist provides receipts</li>
        <li>Receptionist can assign beds for inpatients</li>
        <li>Doctor can record medical reports</li>
        <li>Doctor can request lab tests</li>
        <li>Doctor can request radiology tests</li>
        <li>Lab technician performs tests and sends results</li>
        <li>Radiology technician performs tests and sends reports</li>
        <li>Insurance company can file claims</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>
        From this project I learned how to use UML diagrams to design systems. I also learned 
        about the different types of relationships in UML like include and extend. Working with 
        a team was also good because we had to coordinate and divide the work between us.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The most important thing I learned is that you need to plan and design before you start 
        coding anything. The UML diagrams help developers understand what needs to be built.
